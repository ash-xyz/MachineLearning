\begin{answer}
    It is possible.\\
    Using the hint provided, if we imagine the three neurons as decision boundaries.\\
    If we take $x_1,x_2 = 0.5$ \& $x_1 + x_2 = 4$, this satisfies our decision boundary.\\
    Hence if we take $h_1,h_2,h_3 = 1$, this satisfies our conditions.\\
    This makes sure that o = 1 only if $h_1+h_2+h_3 \geq 1$
