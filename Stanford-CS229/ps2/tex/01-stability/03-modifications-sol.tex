\begin{answer}
    \\(i) No it wouldn't, this is a scaling issue not a learning rate issue.\\
    (ii) Again, a scaling issue, nothing to do with the learning rate\\
    (iii) No, any linear transformation would likely keep the data separate \\
    (iv) Yes, this would penalize large values of $\theta$\\
    (v) This could possible work as the data added could stop it from being linearly separable.\\
    However this doesn't necessarily work for all cases.
