\begin{answer}
    The problem seems to lie within the fact that data set B is linearly separable. Hence it being a scaling issue.\\
    See src/p01.ipynb\\
    Logistic regression attempts to maximize the log likelihood:
    $$
    l(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^m y^{(i)}log\ h(x^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)})log(1-h(x^{(i)}))
    $$
    Where $h_{\theta}$ is the sigmoid function.\\
    Since the data of B is linearly separable the length of $\theta$ can be made arbitrarily long\\
\end{answer}
